### **Update released! (2023/08/21)**  
Cursor Changer 1.13Î²3 (1.13.b3) has been released!  
This update includes a number of minor fixes, but the most significant is the implementation of the update feature. This feature is mainly built by powershell, but it is still great.  
I've been developing it for about two months now and finally got it into shape and implemented it. (The reason it took so long is that I don't know powershell at all myself and created it all with AI. However, I think it turned out pretty good.)  
There are still a large number of missing features in the update functionality, but they will probably be implemented in the official release of 1.13.  

## - **ABOUT THIS BATCH** -
Cursor Chenger was created entirely with batch only.
Im are pursuing what can be done with BATCH processing etc.

This Batch is similar to a *simplified OS*, if you will.
At the very least, it is by far larger and more complex than the Batch around the corner. And I (**tamago1908**) **created all of them by myself.**

Simply put, it would be a single, working batchOS that aims to surpass the quality of all batchOS that have been created to date. It would not be created strictly for the purpose of an OS, but it would come close. Also, unlike other batchOS, this will run in a single batch. No additional files or components are required. (At most you will need a PC with windows 10 1511 or later).

## - **SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS** -
**This batch works only with** ***Windows 10 1511 or later***. **it will not work on earlier versions!** The reason is the special character code coloring and the fact that this batch contains features that do not work in the old powershell.
and if you want run with good performance, you should Prepare good pc.

At a minimum, you will need a CPU that can run some windows 10. (100 or higher In CineBench R15).
Recommended requirements are 2 cores 4 threads, 2.0 Ghz and higher. (230 or higher in CineBench R15)

Basically, the higher the better but too high performance may worsen the appearance of some animations (because the code executes too fast)

Also, the UI and animations of batch may collapse in some environments even though it is running on windows 10 1511 or later. This is probably due to the difference in resolution between the development environment and the actual device, and im currently looking for a solution.

## - **FREATURES** -
The most important feature is the ability to change the cursor. You can change it to white (windows default) or black. It also has a settings menu that allows you to change the behavior of Cursor Changer, a calculator, various easter eggs, hidden functions, advanced behavior using powershell, and much more. And best of all, all of these features are built with only a single BATCH file, no additional files are required!
And this BATCH is still under development, with new new features and patches to come! (at least as long as the developers are motivated)

### ***In creating this BATCH, I were inspired by the following.***

## - **HOW TO USE THIS BAT** -
Download batch file, and just click "**Cursor chenger 1.12.bat**".
then have fun!

## - **PRECAUTIONS** -
This batch generates several new files. The details are explained in the batch process, but two main files are generated: a configuration file and a txt file used to determine initial startup.

The configuration file and a txt file used to determine initial startup.
No other files are generated.

There is no modification of the files except by user operation. In other words, files are not and will not be modified unless operated on by the user.

Deletion of the BATCH process should be done from the uninstall menu that exists inside BATCH.
Manual deletion can be done by deleting the configuration file and the file for determining initial startup.

If you want to go to the path where those files exist, you can access them from the uninstall menu accessible from batch.
Then delete the BATCH process.
