# ***! WANING !***
**FIRST OF ALL, ITS STILL BETA AND THIS VERSION IS STILL** ***NOT SUPPORT ANOTHER LANGUAGE*** (like english)

**SO** ***THIS BATCH IS SUPPORT ONLY JAPANESE AT LEAST NOW!!***

**IF YOU WANT USE THIS BATCH WITH ENGLISH, WAIT UPDATE!**

## - **System Requirements** -
**This batch works only with** ***Windows 10 1511 or later***. **it will not work on earlier versions!** The reason is the special character code coloring and the fact that this batch contains features that do not work in the old powershell.

## - **WHAT IS THIS?** -
Cursor Chenger was created entirely with batch only.
We are pursuing what can be done with BATCH processing etc.

`However, if you ask me why You make it, to tell the truth, I don't know either lol.`

## - **Features** -
Ability to change cursors, brand new CUI-based UI, tons of easter eggs, implement features in ways never done before, change themes, etc.
and much more!

### ***In creating this BATCH process, I were inspired by the following.***

- *Undertale and tobyfox*

- *BSOD (Blue screan of death)*

- *Debios (batch OS)*

- *SAO (Japan Anime, Sword Art Online)*

## - **HOW TO USE THIS BAT** -
just click Cursor chenger 1.12Î²8b.bat.
then have fun!

## - **PRECAUTIONS** -
This batch generates several new files. The details are explained in the batch process, but two main files are generated: a configuration file and a txt file used to determine initial startup.

The configuration file and a txt file used to determine initial startup.
No other files are generated.

There is no modification of the files except by user operation. In other words, files are not and will not be modified unless operated on by the user.

Deletion of the BATCH process should be done from the uninstall menu that exists inside BATCH.
Manual deletion can be done by deleting the configuration file and the file for determining initial startup.

If you want to go to the path where those files exist, you can access them from the uninstall menu accessible from batch.
Then delete the BATCH process.
