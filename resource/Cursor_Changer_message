I don't understand why you clicked on this logo...

But let's talk about what this logo means because you are clicked this logo.
This logo has a cursor and the letter C/ in a circle, which is the first letter of C of Cursor and "C"hanger, with Cursor as the picture of a cursor and Changer as C/ (the first letter of the C drive). However, the C/ is wrong and is actually C:/, which is worrisome. That's why I'm using it as a Placeholder.
Perhaps at some point it will be updated and become C:/. Or it will be renewed.
The exact name of the batch is "Cursor Changer.bat", so .bat may be added. I have sketched out such an idea, but I am not sure if it will be completed.
When I rename it to Cursor Changer OS.bat, I will change the structure of the current logo and make it completely different. But it is more difficult than I thought.
